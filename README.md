## Leonard Madarang's submission of Part 1 of Project 1 for Udacity Android Development Nano Degree

Because this is a public repo, having my API key in the source is frowned upon, so please use your own API key from themoviedg.org and replace the corresponding string on [Line 172 of Movies.Fragment.java](https://github.com/lmadara1/pop-movies/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/example/aggrogahu/popularmovies/MoviesFragment.java#L172)

To change the sorting of movies on the main screen, click the vertical ellipses in the top right corner and choose either the popular or rating sort.
